# Summary of `main.js`

## Overview
The `main.js` file implements functionalities for screen recording in web browsers using the `ScreenCastRecorder` class. It checks for browser compatibility and provides methods to start and stop recording, handling errors and state management throughout the process.

## Key Features
- **Browser Compatibility Check**: The script begins by verifying if the current browser supports screen recording capabilities. If not, it logs an error message.
- **Start and Stop Recording**: 
  - The `startRecording` function initializes the recorder and starts capturing the screen. It supports audio recording and manages error handling via a callback.
  - The `stopRecording` function stops the recording and processes the recorded video, creating a downloadable link for the user.
- **State Management**: The script manages the recording state, transitioning between states like "RECORDING", "OFF", and "PREVIEW_FILE" while providing relevant feedback via console logs.

## Usage
- The file is intended to be used in web applications that require screen recording functionality. 
- Users can invoke `startRecording` and `stopRecording` through global functions attached to the `window` object, making it easy to integrate into user interfaces.
  
## Target Audience
