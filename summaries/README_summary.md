# Summary of `qwen-vl-utils`

## Overview
`qwen-vl-utils` is a utility library designed to facilitate the processing and integration of visual language information with the Qwen-VL Series Model. This library provides a set of helper functions that enhance user interaction with visual content, enabling effective image and video processing.

## Key Features
- **Image and Video Processing**: Users can input images and videos through various methods, including local file paths, URLs, and base64 encoding.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: The library allows dynamic adjustment of image and video sizes to optimize processing.
- **Multi-format Support**: Supports various input formats, including local files, URLs, and PIL images for images, as well as video files and extracted frames for videos.
- **Token Management**: Users can manage token limits for videos through environment variables to fit within model constraints.

## Usage
### Installation
To install the library, use the following command:
```bash
pip install qwen-vl-utils
```

### Example Implementations
1. **Qwen2VL**:
   - Utilizes `Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration` and `AutoProcessor` for processing visual inputs.
   - Supports multiple input formats and processes messages to generate descriptive outputs.

2. **Qwen2.5VL**:
   - Similar to Qwen2VL but uses `Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration`.
   - Allows for setting maximum tokens for video processing through environment variables.

## Target Audience
This utility is aimed at developers and researchers working with visual language models, particularly those utilizing the Qwen-VL Series Model for tasks that involve understanding and generating descriptions based on visual content. It is suitable for applications in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing.

By providing a straightforward interface for integrating visual information, `qwen-vl-utils` enhances the capabilities of models in interpreting and generating language based on images and videos.
